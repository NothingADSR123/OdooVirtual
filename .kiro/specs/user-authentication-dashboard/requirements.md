# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements user authentication and profile management for a marketplace application. Users will be able to sign in using Google authentication through Firebase Auth and manage their profile information through a dedicated dashboard. The system will store and allow editing of user profile data in Firestore, providing a seamless authentication experience with profile customization capabilities.

4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect them from the login page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the site.
