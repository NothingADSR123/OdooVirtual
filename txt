## ✨ Why EcoFinds?
In a world drowning in fast fashion, electronics waste, and disposable culture, EcoFinds empowers people to buy & sell pre-loved goods with ease.  
Every listing extends the lifecycle of a product, reduces carbon footprint, and creates a conscious community of sustainable shoppers.

## 🛠️ Features (MVP)
- 🔐 Secure Authentication – Sign up & log in with ease.

- 🛒 Product Listings (CRUD) – Add, edit, delete, or browse second-hand items.  
- 🗂️ Category Filtering – Quickly find items by predefined categories.  
- 🔍 Search – Find exactly what you’re looking for with keyword search.  
- 🖼️ Image Placeholder Support – Every product gets a visual touch.  
- 📦 Cart & Previous Purchases – Track what you’re buying and what you’ve already bought.
